# Compliance-Reporting-Dashboard-in-Power-BI
Created an interactive Power BI dashboard during my internship at Sodexo to track and analyze compliance metrics. The dashboard provided stakeholders with clear visualisations of key compliance indicators, facilitating faster decision-making and ensuring adherence to organisational standards. 

Key Features:
Dynamic Compliance Tracking: Monitored compliance across multiple regions/departments with customizable filters.
Interactive Visuals: Included charts, tables, and KPIs to highlight performance against targets.
Automated Data Refresh: Ensured real-time reporting by integrating with live data sources.
Error Analysis: Identified trends in non-compliance areas, enabling proactive resolution.
